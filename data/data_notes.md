# UiO

UiO does not offer the Emneplan by year, only the newest version of the Emneplan is available. Therefore, Emneplan was only downloaded for 2025 or, if the course had been discontinued, the last year the course was offered.

# USN

- **Low success rate for Vår courses**: Many courses in DBH are listed for Vår (when students are enrolled), but teaching starts in Høst. USN's website indexes by "Undervisningsstart", so these Vår URLs return NA.
- **Some courses unavailable**: Some plans are PDF-only, not yet published, or show placeholders for future years ("Emneplanen for dette semesteret er ikke klar ennå").
- **Version numbers**: Most courses have 1-2 versions. The resolver tries versions 1-3 by default.
