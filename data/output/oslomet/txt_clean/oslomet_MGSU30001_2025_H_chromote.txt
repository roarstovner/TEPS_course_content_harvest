##  Arbeids- og undervisningsformer
This is a full-time course that builds on principles from place-based education. In addition to exploring urban and natural environments, the course will involve lectures, seminars, student presentations and discussions. This requires active student participation. The students must be prepared to participate in various outdoor activities and be equipped for all weather conditions.
The course will provide opportunities to interact with students from different national backgrounds, and the possibility of exploring the Oslo region. The students are expected to share their understandings of didactic concepts and sustainability dilemmas from their own countries.
All classes are taught in English, and all course requirements and assessment tasks, including written texts and oral examinations, are to be completed in English.An integrated part of the course will be a 15 days’ placement in Norwegian kindergartens or schools. Students are to observe and participate in the educational institutions’ everyday work. In addition, they will plan and carry out sustainability-thematic interdisciplinary pedagogical work in collaboration with teachers at their practice institution. OsloMet’s internal and external partners may enter into this cooperation.
For OsloMet students of Early Childhood Education: The practice period is included in the 6th semester of the educational programme. It is supervised and assessed. Students complete a 15 days’ placement in the topic of study, in addition to 10 days organised by the institute. Practice is obligatory, with a focus on leadership, collaboration and development work. Students are required to carry out a practice assignment, which is published on the OsloMet’s digital learning platform.

##  Arbeidskrav og obligatoriske aktiviteter
The course emphasises student participation, dialogue, and cooperative learning, which depends upon attendance and active participation in class. The course requirements are intended to help the students to acquire the skills specified in the learning outcomes for the course.
The following course requirements must be met before the student can sit the exam:
- Active participation in outdoor and indoor classes and activities (minimum 80% attendance). During the placement period in schools/kindergartens a 100 % attendance is expected.
- Group work: Designing a product which demonstrates an interdisciplinary approach to sustainability in education with aesthetic and/or technological components. Oral presentation in class (approx. 10-20 minutes depending on the size of the groups).
- Group work: Practical didactic work outdoors related to place-based learning as specified in the course plan. The work process and disciplinary considerations will be documented on a digital platform. The group work including the students’ disciplinary considerations is presented for the rest of the class. Feedback will be given both from other students and the course leader. Time for presentation and feedback is 20 minutes.
- Individual work: Written paper on a topic addressed in the course’s learning outcomes (1,500 words, +/- 10%). One supervision will be offered the students for this work. The written paper will be a point of departure for the exam paper.
Course requirements deadlines must be met and are assessed as approved/not approved. All aspects of the course requirements are assessed, both the practical components, the oral presentations, and the written assignments. Valid absence documented by a medical certificate or similar documentation does not exempt students from meeting the course requirements. Students who, due to illness or other valid and documented reasons, do not meet the course requirements by the deadline may be given an extended deadline. A new deadline for meeting the course requirements or submitting compensatory tasks is agreed with the relevant teacher in each case. All course requirements must be approved before the student can sit their exams.
##  Vurdering og eksamen
The final assessment consists of two parts:
- Individual practical oral exam outdoors demonstrating competence in sustainability education and place-based learning (30 minutes). The students are allocated a place outdoors and a topic from the curriculum one week before the exam. The students present an educational project related to the place and topic. The presentation takes place at the actual site and needs to involve a map to provide an overview over the activities proposed and the sites involved. This exam counts for 33% of the final grade. Language: English
- Individual written exam written during the semester and handed in digitally: an article on a chosen topic addressed in the course’s learning outcomes (3000 words, +/- 10%). This exam counts for 67% of the final grade. Language: English
The two grades are used to calculate the overall grade awarded for the course. The final certificate of 30 ECTS credits will be awarded on completion of the above-mentioned requirements and exams.
Resit exam
If a student fails an exam or is absent at the time of the exam for a valid reason, they are entitled to resubmit the written exam the following semester.
