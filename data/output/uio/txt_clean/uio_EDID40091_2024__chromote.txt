## Course content
The master’s thesis allows you to specialise in a self-selected research topic relevant for teaching English a school subject. The research process usually combines theory with the analysis of empirical data, but it is also possible to write a primarily theoretical thesis.
In a thesis that is based on empirical data you may use previously collected and available data, or collect your own. Supervision is intended to help you develop your analytical skills and your ability to convey the findings in accordance with academic conventions.
Your work on the thesis will use the project description you developed in the MA methods courses DIFO4001 – Didaktisk forskningsmetode: design og innsamling av data and DIFO4015 – Didaktisk forskningsmetode med praksis: analyse og framstilling av data as a point of departure.
