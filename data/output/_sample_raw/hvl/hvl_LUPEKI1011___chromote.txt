                            Innhald og oppbygging
                            Emnet skal utvikle studentane sin kunnskap om ulike profesjonar, forståing av eige fagområde og refleksjon over kunnskap og etikk. Dette vert sett i høve til berekraftig utvikling for å fremja perspektiv og teoriar som aukar forståinga av globaliseringa i samtida og gir grunnlag for å meistre samansette uføresette utfordringar. Emnet bidreg til å stimulere studenten til å vere aktiv og nysgjerrig, til å ta ansvar for eiga læring og til å utvikle evna til nyskaping.Berekraft-omgrepet omfattar eit bevaringsperspektiv, men har også i seg ønskje om nyskaping og utvikling. Berekraftastår på tre likestilte pilarar: økologisk berekraft, økonomisk berekraft (til dette høyrer likeverd) og sosio-kulturell berekraft (inkludert global sosial rettferd).Danning seier noko om korleis personlegdom, oppførsel og moral til eit menneske formast i eit samfunn. Menneskets evne til å forma seg og la seg forma med utgangspunkt i kunnskap, haldningar og åtferd hjelper mennesket å leva påein meiningsfull måte i og med verda. Danning er det som tillèt det siviliserte, berekraftige og frie samfunnet å eksistere og gjer det mogleg å takle den historiske situasjonen.Utdanning byggjer menneske og samfunn. Utdanning er mennesket si tileigning av kunnskap, ferdigheiter og evner, einviktig del av danninga som set mennesket i stand til å delta i eit samfunn i endring.Skriveprosessen står sentralt i ei akademisk utdanning, og det akademiske handverket er i emnet knytt til å skrive akademiske tekstar.Emnet går i det første semesteret av studiet og har eit omfang i spennet 5 - 15 studiepoeng, som studieprogramma sjølve fastset. Emnet har ein fellesdel som utgjer 5 studiepoeng og ein utdanningsspesifikk del på 2,5 - 10 studiepoeng. Fellesdelen og utdanningsdelen i emnet utgjer ei integrert eining i undervisninga.Innhaldet i emnet er: etikk, vitskapsteori, vitskaplege metodar, berekraft, akademisk skriving, informasjonskompetanse, kjeldebruk, kommunikasjon, samarbeid og profesjonshistorie. Retningsliner for godkjenningGodkjenning av fellesemnet mellom studieprogram ved HVLHVL-studentar som skiftar studieprogram ved HVL kan etter søknad få godkjend bestått fellesemne med likt omfang eller større ved opptak til nytt studieprogram. Når fellesemnet i nytt studieprogram har større omfang enn i tidlegare studieprogram, må emnet takast opp att i sin heilskap og ny eksamen gjennomførast. Godkjenning av innføringsemne frå andre institusjonarHVL kan etter søknad godkjenne innføringsemne frå beslekta studieprogram frå andre utdanningsinstitusjonar. Ivurderinga er det avgjerande om læringsutbytta er dekkande for fellesemnet i aktuelt studieprogram ved HVL.
