## Om emnet
## Faglig innhold
This course serves as a basis for knowledge in physical education as a general subject as well as the development of competence as a physical education teacher. Through theoretical and practical approaches, the course will focus on the relevance of physical education as a school subject, what promotes pupils' bodily learning, positive self-understanding and joy of movement, teaching in different movement environments, and knowledge about assessment in physical education. In physical education 1-7, play and beginner education are central, whereas physical education 5-10 emphasizes teaching competence in sport and movement activities, outdoor life, play, and dance. Students in LKRO001E will have the opportunity to learn and engage with material for both levels. Further, students will develop their practical didactic competence through planning, implementing and assessing their own and others' teaching practice.

## Læringsformer og aktiviteter
This course aims to develop the student`s competence in physical education for children in Primary and Lower Secondary School. It emphasises a playful approach to activities within outdoor education, play and different sport activities. The teaching will be carried out in various environment and areas. The student will learn how to work with physical education in a didactic perspective and how they can develop the subject further. Practical skills together with theoretical knowledge are therefore emphasised. Physical education includes many aspects where the P.E. teacher has to manage how to organise education for both individuals and larger groups with different needs. Discussions and reflections related to physical education in school will be an important part of this course.
