- In a society committed to eradicating structural inequalities and discrimination – institutionalised or other, ‘difference’ is often thought of in the negative sense of differing from a norm, and, as such, a problem to be dealt with.
- In this course, we will engage critically with various ideas ofdifference through various theories on monsters and the monstrous, 19th century narratives of madness, gothic narratives, and tales of the abnormal.
- Engage critically with the idea of monstrosity in a selection of relevant theory, films, poetry, plays, short stories, and novels from the 19th century to today.
- Read the monster in relation to the culture that engendered it. Consequently, ‘monsters and monstrosity’ will be understood as widely as possible: as metaphors for cultural ‘fears, anxieties and desires’, personal or cultural crises, evil in a secular society – something that ‘warns’ as well as ‘reveals’ (Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, 1996, Monster Theory, p. 4).
