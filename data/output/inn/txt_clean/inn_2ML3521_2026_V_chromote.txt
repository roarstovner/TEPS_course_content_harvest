The premise of this course is that poetry matters for general literacy. We will study a variety of pedagogical theories pertaining to poetry, as well as interdisciplinary approaches such as cognitive poetics to gain insight into how poetry functions in the brain and can stimulate learner’s creativity and educational development. The course will consider how poetry pedagogies can be applied across the lifespan, from early childhood to postsecondary education, and across a variety of diverse types of learners. Students will also be trained to recognize aesthetic dimensions of poetic literacy such as rhyme, metrics, pitch, tone, alliteration, assonance, parallelism, and more.
