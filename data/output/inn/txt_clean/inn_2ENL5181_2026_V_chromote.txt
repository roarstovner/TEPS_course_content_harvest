Three day individual take-home exam graded on a scale from A to F. A is the highest pass grade and E is the lowest pass grade. Language skills, practical translation proficiency and theoretical content must satisfy minimum requirements in order for the candidate to obtain a pass grade. Detailed guidelines and assessment criteria will be specified in the semester plan.
