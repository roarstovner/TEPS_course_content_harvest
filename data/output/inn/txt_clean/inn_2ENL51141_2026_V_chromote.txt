- In periods marked by strong political dissent, democratic societies produce works of art imagining better ways – or worse ones – for (re-)organizing power.
- In this course, we will engage critically with various ideas of utopia and dystopia through diverse theories on idealism, disaster narratives, speculative fiction and the like.
- Engage critically with the idea of utopia/dystopia in a selection of relevant theory, films, poetry, short stories, and novels from the 16th century to today.
