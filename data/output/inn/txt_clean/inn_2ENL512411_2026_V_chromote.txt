Practice
Practice is an integrated part of the subjects included in the 5-year Lecturer Education in Language and Literature. All the courses in the program, together with the practical training, have responsibility for ensuring that students develop professional competence and a strong teacher identity.
To sit the examination a student must:
- have an attendance record of at least 75 % according to the semester plan. Students are responsible for registration of attendance
- have completed and presented, orally and in writing, an individual research project. Both the written and oral component must be approved no later than two weeks before the exam
An individual oral examination, graded on a scale from A to F. A is the highest pass grade and E is the lowest pass grade. Both content and English language skills must satisfy minimum requirements in order for a candidate to obtain a pass grade.
