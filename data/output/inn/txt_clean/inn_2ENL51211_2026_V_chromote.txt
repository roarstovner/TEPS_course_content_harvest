Practice
Practice is an integrated part of the subjects included in the 5-year Lecturer Education in Language and Literature. All the courses in the program, together with the practical training, have responsibility for ensuring that students develop professional competence and a strong teacher identity.
To sit the examination a student must:
- have an attendance record of at least 75 % according to the semester plan. Students are responsible for registration of attendance
- have submitted up to two individual assignments by a date stipulated at the beginning of the semester. The assignments must be approved by the lecturer responsible no later than two weeks before the examination
An individual five-hour written examination, graded on a scale from A to F. A is the highest pass grade and E is the lowest pass grade.
