Practice

To sit the examination a student must:
- have an attendance record of at least 75 % according to the semester plan. Students are responsible for registration of attendance
- have completed a maximum of 5 assignments, of which at least one is oral and one must be written. Details will be outlined at the beginning of the semester. These assignments must be approved no later than two weeks before the examination. A certificate of participation from the Norwegian Study Centre in York will be accepted as substitute for one of the assignments
A five-hour individual written examination, graded on a scale from A to F. A is the highest pass grade and E is the lowest pass grade. Both content and English language skills must satisfy minimum requirements in order for a candidate to obtain a pass grade.
