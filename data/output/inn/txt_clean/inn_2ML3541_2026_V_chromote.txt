- This is an introductory course in reception and adaptation studies. The course will involve close readings of primary texts and adaptations in their historical contexts.
- The course operates from a broad definition of text and reading – films and other cultural expressions are also texts that may be read in this course.
- Working from the premise that all texts are historically situated and acquire new meanings in new contexts, we will explore a number of different works, including works for young adults, from different historical periods and their reception.
- The course will also contain discussions of key theoretical contributions to the field of adaptation and reception studies, didactic theory and praxis-oriented perspectives on the uses of literary texts and adaptations in teaching and other forms of culture work.
