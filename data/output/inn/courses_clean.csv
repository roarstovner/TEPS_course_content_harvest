- In a society committed to eradicating structural inequalities and discrimination – institutionalised or other, ‘difference’ is often thought of in the negative sense of differing from a norm, and, as such, a problem to be dealt with.
- In this course, we will engage critically with various ideas ofdifference through various theories on monsters and the monstrous, 19th century narratives of madness, gothic narratives, and tales of the abnormal.
- Engage critically with the idea of monstrosity in a selection of relevant theory, films, poetry, plays, short stories, and novels from the 19th century to today.
- Read the monster in relation to the culture that engendered it. Consequently, ‘monsters and monstrosity’ will be understood as widely as possible: as metaphors for cultural ‘fears, anxieties and desires’, personal or cultural crises, evil in a secular society – something that ‘warns’ as well as ‘reveals’ (Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, 1996, Monster Theory, p. 4).

Studenten
- kan grunngi synspunkter på hva det vil si å være KRLE-lærer
- kan reflektere kritisk over skolefaget og videreformidle forskning om barn, ungdom, religion og livssyn
Arbeids- og undervisningsformene i KRLE har som mål at studentene skal kunne utforske og presentere de ulike emnene i faget på en objektiv, kritisk og pluralistisk måte. Studiet skal stimulere både til refleksjon over fagstoffet og hvordan KRLE-læreren kan legge til rette for dette i undervisningen. Det legges opp til undervisning og dybdelæring som åpner horisonter og bidrar til kulturell forståelse. Arbeidsmåtene i faget skal i særlig grad fremme dialog og toleranse, noe som forutsetter fagkunnskap, analytiske tilnærminger og samarbeidsevne.
Undervisningen vil bli organisert som forelesninger og seminarer, med studentbidrag, samtale og dialog. Det forventes aktivt selvstudium, både med tanke på emner det foreleses over og emner det ikke gis undervisning i. Arbeid i kollokviegrupper anbefales som en mulighet til felles refleksjon rundt fagstoffet, til arbeid med egne holdninger og til personlig utvikling gjennom faglige og fagdidaktiske diskusjoner. Studentene skal få erfaring med innhenting av kunnskapsmateriale ut over det som ligger i pensumlitteraturen, f.eks. gjennom bruk av bibliotek og arbeid med elektroniske medier. Fokus på kildekritikk og etiske perspektiver ved nettbruk, kunnskapsinnhenting, kunnskapsformidling og kommunikasjon er en del av dette
For at studentene skal komme grundig og godt inn i pensumstoffet, gjøres det bruk av nettbaserte kunnskapsprøver.
Deler av undervisningen kan dekkes gjennom ekskursjoner, f.eks. ved besøk til ulike religioners gudshus. På KRLE 1 inngår det vanligvis et tilbud om være med på studietur til et faglig relevant reisemål i utlandet. Studieturen foregår normalt i overgangen april/mai.

Arbeids- og undervisningsformene i KRLE har som mål at studentene skal kunne utforske og presentere de ulike emnene i faget på en objektiv, kritisk og pluralistisk måte. KRLE-lærere på 1.-7. trinn må kunne forstå elevenes kognitive, utviklingsmessige og kulturelle ståsted og være gode samtalepartnere i spørsmål om religion, livssyn, etikk og filosofi. Det må derfor i studiet stimuleres både til refleksjon over fagstoffet og egne livstolkninger, og legges opp til en undervisning og dybdelæring som åpner horisonter og bidrar til kulturell forståelse. Arbeidsmåtene i faget skal i særlig grad fremme dialog og toleranse, noe som forutsetter fagkunnskap, analytiske tilnærminger og samarbeidsevne.
Undervisningen vil bli organisert som forelesninger og seminarer, med studentbidrag, samtale og dialog. Det forventes aktivt selvstudium, både med tanke på emner det foreleses over og emner det ikke gis undervisning i. Arbeid i kollokviegrupper anbefales som en mulighet til felles refleksjon rundt fagstoffet, til arbeid med egne holdninger og til personlig utvikling gjennom faglige og fagdidaktiske diskusjoner. Studentene skal få erfaring med innhenting av kunnskapsmateriale ut over det som ligger i pensumlitteraturen, f.eks. gjennom bruk av bibliotek og arbeid med elektroniske medier. Fokus på kildekritikk og etiske perspektiver ved nettbruk, kunnskapsinnhenting, kunnskapsformidling og kommunikasjon er en del av dette
Deler av undervisningen kan dekkes gjennom ekskursjoner, f.eks. ved besøk til ulike religioners gudshus. På KRLE 1 inngår det vanligvis et tilbud om være med på studietur til et faglig relevant reisemål i utlandet. Studieturen foregår normalt i overgangen april/mai.
Praksis
Praksisstudiet er en integrert del av fagene som inngår i utdanningen. Alle fag i utdanningen har sammen med praksisstudiet ansvar for at studentene utvikler identitet som lærer. Det skal være nær kopling mellom innhold og arbeidsmåter i lærerutdanningsfagene og praksisstudiet. Veiledning og vurdering av studenter i praksisstudiet er et felles ansvarsområde for faglærerne i grunnskolelærerutdanningene, praksislærer og rektor.
Studentene skal utføre oppgaver i praksisperioden i henhold til undervisningsplanen og delta på profesjonsseminar på høgskolen.
- Emnet har inntil to skriftlige arbeidskrav. Arbeidskravene vil være individuelle, og/eller i grupper. Detaljerte retningslinjer og innleveringsfrister vil gå fram av undervisningsplanen.

Arbeids- og undervisningsformene i KRLE har som mål at studentene skal kunne utforske og presentere de ulike emnene i faget på en objektiv, kritisk og pluralistisk måte. Studiet skal stimulere både til refleksjon over fagstoffet og hvordan KRLE-læreren kan legge til rette for dette i undervisningen. Det legges opp til undervisning og dybdelæring som åpner horisonter og bidrar til kulturell forståelse. Arbeidsmåtene i faget skal i særlig grad fremme dialog og toleranse, noe som forutsetter fagkunnskap, analytiske tilnærminger og samarbeidsevne.
Undervisningen vil bli organisert som forelesninger og seminarer, med studentbidrag, samtale og dialog. Det forventes aktivt selvstudium, både med tanke på emner det foreleses over og emner det ikke gis undervisning i. Arbeid i kollokviegrupper anbefales som en mulighet til felles refleksjon rundt fagstoffet, til arbeid med egne holdninger og til personlig utvikling gjennom faglige og fagdidaktiske diskusjoner. Studentene skal få erfaring med innhenting av kunnskapsmateriale ut over det som ligger i pensumlitteraturen, f.eks. gjennom bruk av bibliotek og arbeid med elektroniske medier. Fokus på kildekritikk og etiske perspektiver ved nettbruk, kunnskapsinnhenting, kunnskapsformidling og kommunikasjon er en del av dette
For at studentene skal komme grundig og godt inn i pensumstoffet, gjøres det bruk av nettbaserte kunnskapsprøver.
Deler av undervisningen kan dekkes gjennom ekskursjoner, f.eks. ved besøk til ulike religioners gudshus. På KRLE 1 inngår det vanligvis et tilbud om være med på studietur til et faglig relevant reisemål i utlandet. Studieturen foregår normalt i overgangen april/mai.
Praksis
Praksisstudiet er en integrert del av fagene som inngår i utdanningen. Alle fag i utdanningen har sammen med praksisstudiet ansvar for at studentene utvikler identitet som lærer. Det skal være nær kopling mellom innhold og arbeidsmåter i lærerutdanningsfagene og praksisstudiet. Veiledning og vurdering av studenter i praksisstudiet er et felles ansvarsområde for faglærerne i grunnskolelærerutdanningene, praksislærer og rektor.
Studentene skal utføre oppgaver i praksisperioden i henhold til undervisningsplanen og delta på profesjonsseminar på høgskolen.
- Nettbaserte kunnskapsprøver i deler av faget, jf. Undervisningsplanen
- Deltakelse i seminarer, jf. undervisningsplanen
- 75 % obligatorisk frammøte til undervisning i henhold til undervisningsplanen. Studenten er selv ansvarlig for å bli registrert
Individuell 5-timers skriftlig eksamen.
Prestasjonen vurderes med graderte bokstavkarakterer fra A-F, der E er laveste ståkarakter.

Arbeids- og undervisningsformene i KRLE har som mål at studentene skal kunne utforske og presentere de ulike emnene i faget på en objektiv, kritisk og pluralistisk måte. KRLE-lærere på 5.-10. trinn må kunne forstå elevenes kognitive, utviklingsmessige og kulturelle ståsted og være gode samtalepartnere i spørsmål om religion, livssyn, etikk og filosofi. Det må derfor i studiet stimuleres både til refleksjon over fagstoffet og egne livstolkninger, og legges opp til en undervisning og dybdelæring som åpner horisonter og bidrar til kulturell forståelse. Arbeidsmåtene i faget skal i særlig grad fremme dialog og toleranse, noe som forutsetter fagkunnskap, analytiske tilnærminger og samarbeidsevne.
Undervisningen vil bli organisert som forelesninger og seminarer, med studentbidrag, samtale og dialog.

Andrespråksdidaktikk er primært innrettet mot undervisning av elever i norsk skole som ikke har norsk som førstespråk, enten ved at de har vokst opp i Norge i et hjem der et annet språk enn norsk er det eneste eller det primære kommunikasjonsspråket, eller ved at de har kommet til Norge i løpet av skolealderen. Andrespråksdidaktiske perspektiver på barnehage og voksenopplæring vil også bli tatt opp. Utgangspunktet er allmenne teorier om flerspråklighet, læring og undervisning. Vi tar for oss opplæring i et andrespråk, og i situasjoner der et andrespråk er opplæringsspråk for andre fag. Hovedfokus vil ligge på norsk som andrespråk. Emnet sammenligner norsk med andre språk ut fra språktypologiske teorier, og presenterer modeller for beskrivelse, analyse og evaluering av muntlig og skriftlig produksjon og resepsjon, så vel som språklig bevissthet.

This is an introductory course in reception studies. The course will involve close readings of primary texts and investigations into their historical reception. Film adaptations will receive special focus. This will be combined with discussions of key theoretical contributions to the field. Working from the premise that all texts are historically situated and acquire new meanings in new contexts, we will explore the reception history of a number of different texts from different historical periods. The course operates from a broad definition of text and reading – films and other cultural expressions are also texts that may be read. Skills in reception studies will raise awareness of how texts are read and understood, by oneself and others, ultimately serving to empower students, pupils and other readers in their interpretations of literary texts and films. These skills will be connected to relevant didactic theory.
- A selection of literary texts and films
