Course content
In periods marked by strong political dissent, democratic societies produce works of art imagining better ways <U+2013> or worse ones <U+2013> for (re-)organizing power.

Arbeids- og undervisningsformer

Undervisningen gis i form av oversiktsforelesninger med grunnleggende innf<U+00F8>ring i de ulike fagemnene. Emner som krever s<U+00E6>rlig forklaring og utdyping vektlegges. Samtale, diskusjon og aktiv deltakelse er viktige undervisningsformer i grunnskolen, og vil derfor ogs<U+00E5> st<U+00E5> sentralt i studiet. Fagdidaktikk er en viktig del av alle fagomr<U+00E5>der. Detaljerte undervisningsplaner viser hvilke temaer som til enhver tid er aktuelle.

Det er bare deler av pensum som dekkes av undervisningen. Derfor vil selvstudium st<U+00E5> sentralt for <U+00E5> tilegne seg et godt grep p<U+00E5> faget. Det oppfordres ogs<U+00E5> til bruk av kollokviegrupper. Fortrolighet med kritisk innhenting av kunnskap og informasjon via bibliotek, elektroniske medier og andre medier styrker det faglige arbeidet, og bidrar til at aktualitetsperspektivet holdes levende. Det gj<U+00F8>res bruk av nettbasert studiest<U+00F8>ttesystem til informasjon, kommunikasjon, formidling og oppgavel<U+00F8>sning.

I dette emnet inng<U+00E5>r arbeid med en individuell skriftlig FOU-oppgave eller fordypningsoppgave p<U+00E5> 3000-4000 ord. Oppgavens innhold skal knyttes til de faglige og fagdidaktiske tema p<U+00E5> dette emnet.

P<U+00E5> KRLE 2 inng<U+00E5>r det vanligvis et tilbud om v<U+00E6>re med p<U+00E5> studietur til et faglig relevant reisem<U+00E5>l i utlandet. Studieturen foreg<U+00E5>r normalt i overgangen april/mai.

kan samarbeide med elever, kolleger, foresatte og akt<U+00F8>rer i lokalmilj<U+00F8>et
Arbeids- og undervisningsformer

Arbeids- og undervisningsformene i KRLE har som m<U+00E5>l at studentene skal kunne utforske og presentere de ulike emnene i faget p<U+00E5> en objektiv, kritisk og pluralistisk m<U+00E5>te. KRLE-l<U+00E6>rere p<U+00E5> 1.-7. trinn m<U+00E5> kunne forst<U+00E5> elevenes kognitive, utviklingsmessige og kulturelle st<U+00E5>sted og v<U+00E6>re gode samtalepartnere i sp<U+00F8>rsm<U+00E5>l om religion, livssyn, etikk og filosofi. Det m<U+00E5> derfor i studiet stimuleres b<U+00E5>de til refleksjon over fagstoffet og egne livstolkninger, og legges opp til en undervisning og dybdel<U+00E6>ring som <U+00E5>pner horisonter og bidrar til kulturell forst<U+00E5>else. Arbeidsm<U+00E5>tene i faget skal i s<U+00E6>rlig grad fremme dialog og toleranse, noe som forutsetter fagkunnskap, analytiske tiln<U+00E6>rminger og samarbeidsevne.

Undervisningen vil bli organisert som forelesninger og seminarer, med studentbidrag, samtale og dialog. Det forventes aktivt selvstudium, b<U+00E5>de med tanke p<U+00E5> emner det foreleses over og emner det ikke gis undervisning i. Arbeid i kollokviegrupper anbefales som en mulighet til felles refleksjon rundt fagstoffet, til arbeid med egne holdninger og til personlig utvikling gjennom faglige og fagdidaktiske diskusjoner. Studentene skal f<U+00E5> erfaring med innhenting av kunnskapsmateriale ut over det som ligger i pensumlitteraturen, f.eks. gjennom bruk av bibliotek og arbeid med elektroniske medier. Fokus p<U+00E5> kildekritikk og etiske perspektiver ved nettbruk, kunnskapsinnhenting, kunnskapsformidling og kommunikasjon er en del av dette

Deler av undervisningen kan dekkes gjennom ekskursjoner, f.eks. ved bes<U+00F8>k til ulike religioners gudshus. P<U+00E5> KRLE 1 inng<U+00E5>r det vanligvis et tilbud om v<U+00E6>re med p<U+00E5> studietur til et faglig relevant reisem<U+00E5>l i utlandet. Studieturen foreg<U+00E5>r normalt i overgangen april/mai.

kan samarbeide med elever, kolleger, foresatte og akt<U+00F8>rer i lokalmilj<U+00F8>et
Arbeids- og undervisningsformer

Arbeids- og undervisningsformene i KRLE har som m<U+00E5>l at studentene skal kunne utforske og presentere de ulike emnene i faget p<U+00E5> en objektiv, kritisk og pluralistisk m<U+00E5>te. KRLE-l<U+00E6>rere p<U+00E5> 5.-10. trinn m<U+00E5> kunne forst<U+00E5> elevenes kognitive, utviklingsmessige og kulturelle st<U+00E5>sted og v<U+00E6>re gode samtalepartnere i sp<U+00F8>rsm<U+00E5>l om religion, livssyn, etikk og filosofi. Det m<U+00E5> derfor i studiet stimuleres b<U+00E5>de til refleksjon over fagstoffet og egne livstolkninger, og legges opp til en undervisning og dybdel<U+00E6>ring som <U+00E5>pner horisonter og bidrar til kulturell forst<U+00E5>else. Arbeidsm<U+00E5>tene i faget skal i s<U+00E6>rlig grad fremme dialog og toleranse, noe som forutsetter fagkunnskap, analytiske tiln<U+00E6>rminger og samarbeidsevne.

Undervisningen vil bli organisert som forelesninger og seminarer, med studentbidrag, samtale og dialog. Det forventes aktivt selvstudium, b<U+00E5>de med tanke p<U+00E5> emner det foreleses over og emner det ikke gis undervisning i. Arbeid i kollokviegrupper anbefales som en mulighet til felles refleksjon rundt fagstoffet, til arbeid med egne holdninger og til personlig utvikling gjennom faglige og fagdidaktiske diskusjoner. Studentene skal f<U+00E5> erfaring med innhenting av kunnskapsmateriale ut over det som ligger i pensumlitteraturen, f.eks. gjennom bruk av bibliotek og arbeid med elektroniske medier. Fokus p<U+00E5> kildekritikk og etiske perspektiver ved nettbruk, kunnskapsinnhenting, kunnskapsformidling og kommunikasjon er en del av dette

Deler av undervisningen kan dekkes gjennom ekskursjoner, f.eks. ved bes<U+00F8>k til ulike religioners gudshus. P<U+00E5> KRLE 1 inng<U+00E5>r det vanligvis et tilbud om v<U+00E6>re med p<U+00E5> studietur til et faglig relevant reisem<U+00E5>l i utlandet. Studieturen foreg<U+00E5>r normalt i overgangen april/mai.

Praksis

Praksisstudiet er en integrert del av fagene som inng<U+00E5>r i utdanningen. Alle fag i utdanningen har sammen med praksisstudiet ansvar for at studentene utvikler identitet som l<U+00E6>rer. Det skal v<U+00E6>re n<U+00E6>r kopling mellom innhold og arbeidsm<U+00E5>ter i l<U+00E6>rerutdanningsfagene og praksisstudiet. Veiledning og vurdering av studenter i praksisstudiet er et felles ansvarsomr<U+00E5>de for fagl<U+00E6>rerne i grunnskolel<U+00E6>rerutdanningene, praksisl<U+00E6>rer og rektor.

Studentene skal utf<U+00F8>re oppgaver i praksisperioden i henhold til undervisningsplanen og delta p<U+00E5> profesjonsseminar p<U+00E5> h<U+00F8>gskolen.

Obligatoriske aktiviteter
Inntil to skriftlige arbeidskrav. Arbeidskravene vil v<U+00E6>re individuelle, og/eller i grupper. Detaljerte retningslinjer og innleveringsfrister vil g<U+00E5> fram av undervisningsplanen.

Praksis

Praksisstudiet er en integrert del av fagene som inng<U+00E5>r i utdanningen. Alle fag i utdanningen har sammen med praksisstudiet ansvar for at studentene utvikler identitet som l<U+00E6>rer. Det skal v<U+00E6>re n<U+00E6>r kopling mellom innhold og arbeidsm<U+00E5>ter i l<U+00E6>rerutdanningsfagene og praksisstudiet. Veiledning og vurdering av studenter i praksisstudiet er et felles ansvarsomr<U+00E5>de for fagl<U+00E6>rerne i grunnskolel<U+00E6>rerutdanningene, praksisl<U+00E6>rer og rektor. Studentene skal utf<U+00F8>re oppgaver i praksisperioden i henhold til undervisningsplanen og delta p<U+00E5> profesjonsseminar p<U+00E5> h<U+00F8>gskolen.

Arbeids- og undervisningsformer

Undervisningen gis i form av oversiktsforelesninger med grunnleggende innf<U+00F8>ring i de ulike fagemnene. Emner som krever s<U+00E6>rlig forklaring og utdyping vektlegges. Samtale, diskusjon og aktiv deltakelse er viktige undervisningsformer i grunnskolen, og vil derfor ogs<U+00E5> st<U+00E5> sentralt i studiet. Fagdidaktikk er en viktig del av alle fagomr<U+00E5>der. Detaljerte undervisningsplaner viser hvilke temaer som til enhver tid er aktuelle.

Det er bare deler av pensum som dekkes av undervisningen. Derfor vil selvstudium st<U+00E5> sentralt for <U+00E5> tilegne seg et godt grep p<U+00E5> faget. Det oppfordres ogs<U+00E5> til bruk av kollokviegrupper. Fortrolighet med kritisk innhenting av kunnskap og informasjon via bibliotek, elektroniske medier og andre medier styrker det faglige arbeidet, og bidrar til at aktualitetsperspektivet holdes levende. Det gj<U+00F8>res bruk av nettbaserte studiest<U+00F8>ttesystemer til informasjon, kommunikasjon, formidling og oppgavel<U+00F8>sning.

I dette emnet inng<U+00E5>r arbeid med en individuell skriftlig FOU-oppgave eller fordypningsoppgave p<U+00E5> 3000 - 4000 ord. Oppgavens innhold skal knyttes til de faglige tema i dette emnet.

P<U+00E5> KRLE 2 inng<U+00E5>r det vanligvis et tilbud om v<U+00E6>re med p<U+00E5> studietur til et faglig relevant reisem<U+00E5>l i utlandet. Studieturen foreg<U+00E5>r normalt i overgangen april/mai.

Praksis

Praksisstudiet er en integrert del av fagene som inng<U+00E5>r i utdanningen. Alle fag i utdanningen har sammen med praksisstudiet ansvar for at studentene utvikler identitet som l<U+00E6>rer. Det skal v<U+00E6>re n<U+00E6>r kopling mellom innhold og arbeidsm<U+00E5>ter i l<U+00E6>rerutdanningsfagene og praksisstudiet. Veiledning og vurdering av studenter i praksisstudiet er et felles ansvarsomr<U+00E5>de for fagl<U+00E6>rerne i grunnskolel<U+00E6>rerutdanningene, praksisl<U+00E6>rer og rektor.

Studentene skal utf<U+00F8>re oppgaver i praksisperioden i henhold til undervisningsplanen og delta p<U+00E5> profesjonsseminar p<U+00E5> h<U+00F8>gskolen.

Arbeids- og undervisningsformer

Emnet g<U+00E5>r over ett semester, hvor praktisk aktivitet vektlegges i forhold til teori. Sentrale deler av teorien vil bli belyst gjennom forelesninger og praktisk undervisning.

Undervisningen vil initiere l<U+00E6>ring, men l<U+00E6>ring skjer ved studentenes egeninnsats. Denne prosessen tar utgangspunkt i praktisk arbeid, forelesninger, gruppearbeid, bruk av digitale verkt<U+00F8>y, l<U+00E6>ringsplattform, veiledet praksis, og aktiv deltakelse i utviklingsprosjekter.

 

Praksis

Praksisstudiet er en integrert del av fagene som inng<U+00E5>r i utdanningen. Alle fag i utdanningen har sammen med praksisstudiet ansvar for at studentene utvikler identitet som l<U+00E6>rer. Det skal v<U+00E6>re n<U+00E6>r kopling mellom innhold og arbeidsm<U+00E5>ter i l<U+00E6>rerutdanningsfagene og praksisstudiet. Veiledning og vurdering av studenter i praksisstudiet er et felles ansvarsomr<U+00E5>de for fagl<U+00E6>rerne i grunnskolel<U+00E6>rerutdanningene, praksisl<U+00E6>rer og rektor. Studentene skal utf<U+00F8>re oppgaver i praksisperioden i henhold til undervisningsplanen og delta p<U+00E5> profesjonsseminar p<U+00E5> h<U+00F8>gskolen i de semestre hvor det er praksisstudium

Arbeidsm<U+00E5>tene skal fremme aktiv studentdeltakelse og utvikle evnen til analyse av l<U+00E6>ringsm<U+00E5>l, samarbeid, dr<U+00F8>fting og refleksjon. Det vil ogs<U+00E5> v<U+00E6>re aktuelt med noe nettbasert undervisning. 

For at studentene skal f<U+00E5> trening i arbeidsm<U+00E5>ter som de vil trenge i l<U+00E6>reryrket, vil det bli lagt vekt p<U+00E5> aktiviteter som krever ferdigheter i <U+00E5> formidle, kommunisere, samarbeide og lede. 

Studentene b<U+00F8>r v<U+00E6>re oppmerksomme p<U+00E5> at ikke alle fagets temaer kan behandles i forelesninger eller seminarer. Det er studentenes ansvar <U+00E5> sette seg inn i, reflektere over og tilegne seg pensum.

Studiet inneholder praksis og studentene skal utf<U+00F8>re praksisoppgaver i henhold til undervisningsplanen, delta p<U+00E5> alle seminardagene p<U+00E5> h<U+00F8>gskolen i praksisperioden, og forberede og delta i trepartsamtaler p<U+00E5> profesjonsseminaret etter praksisperioden.

Undervisningsplaner er tilgjengelige ved oppstarten av semesteret. I undervisningsplanen er det detaljerte oversikter over obligatorisk undervisning, organisering, aktuelt pensum og obligatoriske innleveringsoppgaver. 

Praksis

Praksisstudiet er en integrert del av fagene som inng<U+00E5>r i utdanningen. Alle fag i utdanningen har sammen med praksisstudiet ansvar for at studentene utvikler identitet som l<U+00E6>rer. Det skal v<U+00E6>re n<U+00E6>r kopling mellom innhold og arbeidsm<U+00E5>ter i l<U+00E6>rerutdanningsfagene og praksisstudiet. Veiledning og vurdering av studenter i praksisstudiet er et felles ansvarsomr<U+00E5>de for fagl<U+00E6>rerne i grunnskolel<U+00E6>rerutdanningene, praksisl<U+00E6>rer og rektor.

Studentene skal utf<U+00F8>re oppgaver i praksisperioden i henhold til undervisningsplanen og delta p<U+00E5> profesjonsseminar p<U+00E5> h<U+00F8>gskolen.

Emnets innhold
Den eldre spr<U+00E5>khistorien ser p<U+00E5> utviklingen av moderne norsk ut fra et fellesnordisk utgangspunkt og konsolideringen av et gammalnorsk/gammalislandsk skriftspr<U+00E5>k.
Den nyere spr<U+00E5>khistorien trekker linjene videre via mellomnorsk til moderne norsk med fokus p<U+00E5> utviklingen av bokm<U+00E5>l og nynorsk og m<U+00E5>lformenes plass i samfunnet i dag.
M<U+00E5>lf<U+00F8>re og sosiolingvistikk ser p<U+00E5> talem<U+00E5>let i geografisk og sosiologisk perspektiv, som ogs<U+00E5> inkluderer tospr<U+00E5>klighet.
Kunnskap om nabospr<U+00E5>kene skal gi en st<U+00F8>rre forst<U+00E5>else av det skandinaviske spr<U+00E5>kfellesskapet.
Praktisk spr<U+00E5>kbruk har et fokus p<U+00E5> skriftspr<U+00E5>k, gjerne med et kontrastivt perspektiv p<U+00E5> bokm<U+00E5>l og nynorsk.

Course content
In a society committed to eradicating structural inequalities and discrimination <U+2013> institutionalised or other, <U+2018>difference<U+2019> is often thought of in the negative sense of differing from a norm, and, as such, a problem to be dealt with.
In this course, we will engage critically with various ideas ofdifference through various theories on monsters and the monstrous, 19th century narratives of madness, gothic narratives, and tales of the abnormal.
Engage critically with the idea of monstrosity in a selection of relevant theory, films, poetry, plays, short stories, and novels from the 19th century to today.
Read the monster in relation to the culture that engendered it. Consequently, <U+2018>monsters and monstrosity<U+2019> will be understood as widely as possible: as metaphors for cultural <U+2018>fears, anxieties and desires<U+2019>, personal or cultural crises, evil in a secular society <U+2013> something that <U+2018>warns<U+2019> as well as <U+2018>reveals<U+2019> (Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, 1996, Monster Theory, p. 4).

Course content

This is an introductory course in reception studies. The course will involve close readings of primary texts and investigations into their historical reception. Film adaptations will receive special focus. This will be combined with discussions of key theoretical contributions to the field. Working from the premise that all texts are historically situated and acquire new meanings in new contexts, we will explore the reception history of a number of different texts from different historical periods. The course operates from a broad definition of text and reading <U+2013> films and other cultural expressions are also texts that may be read. Skills in reception studies will raise awareness of how texts are read and understood, by oneself and others, ultimately serving to empower students, pupils and other readers in their interpretations of literary texts and films. These skills will be connected to relevant didactic theory.

Emnets innhold

Andrespr<U+00E5>ksdidaktikk er prim<U+00E6>rt innrettet mot undervisning av elever i norsk skole som ikke har norsk som f<U+00F8>rstespr<U+00E5>k, enten ved at de har vokst opp i Norge i et hjem der et annet spr<U+00E5>k enn norsk er det eneste eller det prim<U+00E6>re kommunikasjonsspr<U+00E5>ket, eller ved at de har kommet til Norge i l<U+00F8>pet av skolealderen. Andrespr<U+00E5>ksdidaktiske perspektiver p<U+00E5> barnehage og voksenoppl<U+00E6>ring vil ogs<U+00E5> bli tatt opp. Utgangspunktet er allmenne teorier om flerspr<U+00E5>klighet, l<U+00E6>ring og undervisning. Vi tar for oss oppl<U+00E6>ring i et andrespr<U+00E5>k, og i situasjoner der et andrespr<U+00E5>k er oppl<U+00E6>ringsspr<U+00E5>k for andre fag. Hovedfokus vil ligge p<U+00E5> norsk som andrespr<U+00E5>k. Emnet sammenligner norsk med andre spr<U+00E5>k ut fra spr<U+00E5>ktypologiske teorier, og presenterer modeller for beskrivelse, analyse og evaluering av muntlig og skriftlig produksjon og resepsjon, s<U+00E5> vel som spr<U+00E5>klig bevissthet.
